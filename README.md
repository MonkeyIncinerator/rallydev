### Rally plugin for Intellij

Implements Intellij's Agile ALM integration.
Forked from:
https://github.com/RallySoftware/intellij-plugin
Ported from groovy on java. Heavily reworked.
To work with Rally I used original Rally java api from:
https://github.com/RallyTools/RallyRestToolkitForJava
Also I created helper library which take hides a lot of boilerplate code:
