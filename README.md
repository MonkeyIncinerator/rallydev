# Rally plugin for Intellij

Implements Intellij's Agile ALM integration.
1. Forked from: https://github.com/RallySoftware/intellij-plugin
2. Ported from groovy on java. Heavily reworked.
3. To work with Rally I used original Rally java api from: https://github.com/RallyTools/RallyRestToolkitForJava
4. Also I created helper library which take hides a lot of boilerplate code: https://github.com/crc83/rally-api-helper
